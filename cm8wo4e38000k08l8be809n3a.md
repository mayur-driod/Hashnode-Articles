I wanted to add animation elements to my website to make it more interesting and attractive… I wanted something similar to this:

![Typewriter Animation That Handles Anything You Throw at It | CSS-Tricks](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/typewriter-animation-text.gif?fit=900%2C450&ssl=1 align="left")

So, I started researching how to add animation to a Vite x React project. One idea was to create an actual GIF and display it, although if I needed to make any changes, I would have to recreate the GIF all over again. Another idea was to use the inbuilt CSS keyframe feature that I had used in another part of the webpage, which was the skills section.

Since I was already familiar with keyframes and I required it to only trigger when the user scrolls to a particular section, I decided to explore whether I could dynamically apply animations using React `useEffect` and `useRef` hooks. After some research, I came across the [**Intersection Observer API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API), which allows elements to detect when they enter or leave the viewport. This seemed like a great solution because it meant I could trigger animations only when the element became visible, improving performance and making interactions way more dynamic.

I implemented this by creating a reference (`useRef`) to track the element and then used `useEffect` to set up an `IntersectionObserver`. The observer checked when at least **50%** of the element was visible, applying the **typewriter animation** dynamically. If the element left the viewport, the animation was reset, ensuring it would play again the next time it appeared…

With this approach, I achieved a smooth typewriter effect without relying on static GIFs, making the animation more flexible and reusable. Plus, it aligned well with the CSS keyframe techniques I had already used, maintaining a consistent design throughout the website.

Here is the program I wrote:

```javascript
  const typewriterRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Add Intersection Observer
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (entries) => {
        entries.forEach((entry) => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            // Add typewriter animation dynamically
            const element = entry.target;
            element.style.animation =
              "typing 2s steps(40, end), blink 0.8s steps(40,end)";
          } else {
            // Reset animation when leaving the viewport
            const element = entry.target;
            element.style.animation = "none";
          }
        });
      },
      { threshold: 0.5 } // Trigger when 50% of the element is visible
    );

    // Observe the h1 element
    if (typewriterRef.current) {
      observer.observe(typewriterRef.current);
    }

    // Cleanup the observer
    return () => {
      if (typewriterRef.current) {
        observer.unobserve(typewriterRef.current);
      }
    };
  }, []);
```
