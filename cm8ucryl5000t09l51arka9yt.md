**I Have Decided to Create a Portfolio**

For a long time, I’ve been working on projects, learning new technologies, and building my skills in software development. But one thing has always been missing—an actual place to showcase everything I’ve done. That’s why I’ve decided to create a portfolio.

### Why a Portfolio?

A portfolio isn’t just a collection of work; it’s a way to present my journey, skills, and growth as a developer. It serves multiple purposes:

* **Proof of Work** – Instead of just listing skills on a resume, I can showcase actual projects.
    
* **Personal Branding** – A well-designed portfolio reflects my personality, creativity, and approach to problem-solving.
    
* **Opportunities** – Whether it’s job offers, freelance gigs, or collaborations, a portfolio increases visibility and credibility.
    

### My Plan for the Portfolio

I want my portfolio to be more than just a static page with links. Here’s what I have in mind:

* **A Clean, Responsive Design** – The portfolio should look great on any device.
    
* **Showcasing Projects** – Each project will have a dedicated section with descriptions, technologies used, and live demos.
    
* **Contact & Social Links** – A way for people to connect with me easily.
    

### Tech Stack Considerations

Since I’ve been working with React and exploring full-stack development, I plan to use:

* **Frontend**: React with Vanilla CSS for styling.
    
* **Hosting**: Netlify, or GitHub Pages for deployment.
    

### Ideas for the website

My vision is to display two of my most dear interests in life which are Software and Photography. I want to be able to show both of them separately but on the same page. I am considering using something like a toggle button on the main page which lets you toggle between my two interests and see details about both of them.

### The Challenges Ahead

Creating a portfolio isn’t just about coding—it’s about design, content, and consistency. I need to balance simplicity with functionality and ensure it represents my work effectively.

### What’s Next?

I’ll be documenting my progress, challenges, and learnings as I build this portfolio. If you’re also working on your portfolio, let’s connect and share insights!

Looking forward to the journey…
